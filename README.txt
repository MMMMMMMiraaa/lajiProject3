Assignment number: Project 3
Lab Section: MW 12:30-1:45
We did not copy code from anyone on this assignment;

In this project users can fire two projectiles by clicking the "Add a new projectile" button, and by clicking the "Delete the new projectile", users can delete the second projectile.
This is the second question for extra credit.

The projecteils can explode for two times-breaks into pieces after the first explosion andshoot off in different directions.
This is the third question for extra credit.

Users can see the explosion by clicking the "Start launching" button.

The arc shows in the canvas represents routes for the first explosion of the projectiles.

Users can choose different parameters by using the sliders on each side of the frame(if users choose to fire two projectiles, 
or it will only shows sliders on the left-hand side): users can choose speeds of projectiles(from 50 to 130), angles of projectiles(from 30 to 90), 
times of firing projectiles(from 0 to 10) for the first explosion.
(If there is no projectile shows in the canvas it means you fires the projectil out of the canvas or you set time as 0, please select the parameters again.)

For the second explosion, users can also set different parameters: number of projectiles in the second explosion from the position of the first explosion(from 1 to 3) 
and the time of the second explosion(from 0 to 10).
(If users choose 1 for the number, it will show the original first explosion)

Users can also choose different colors and explosion types for the explosions by choosing the RadioButtons for colors and explosion types
(first explosion and second explosion have the same color and explosion type).
